### What I learned

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) to set the city and country underneath the time
- [Quotes API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)
